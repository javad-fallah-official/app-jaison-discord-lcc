## About The Project

Discord Bot app plugin for [Project J.A.I.son](https://github.com/limitcantcode/jaison-core). Can text and chat in voice call.

### Installation

This project was tested on python3.12

1. Create and activate your virtual environment using `conda` or `venv`.
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setup [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Ensure your bot has the right OAuth2 permissions when it joins your server (Scope -> Bot, Bot Permissions -> Administrator if unsure). Invite your bot to your server.
4. Setup `.env` file following `.env-template`. You can find you Discord Bot token after creating a bot as shown below:

5. Setup `config.yaml` to where [jaison-core](https://github.com/limitcantcode/jaison-core) is running. `jaison-api-endpoint` should start with `http(s)://` and `jaison-ws-endpoint` with `ws://`

## Usage

After setting things up, you can simply run `python ./src/main.py`

For runtime options, run `python ./src/main.py --help`

Texting works like texting a friend. As long as the bot can see the channel, they will respond.

Have the bot join the channel using `/join_vc`. Have them leave using `/leave_vc`. Talking is also like talking to a friend. No need to time recordings, just talk and wait.
